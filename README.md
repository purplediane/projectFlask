# projectFlask

Final Project (a restaurant menu app üçîüçïüç§) from the Udacity class Fullstack Foundations. Needs more CSS work and some cleanup, probably. Stole the CSS from my DjangoGirls blog, so some doesn't apply. Originally in the class, we used Vagrant VM but I extracted this part out.

Haven't converted it to a real website yet. Hoping to put it on PythonAnywhere
or Heroku sometime in the near future, just for fun.

To run it locally, create a virtualenv in Python 2.7 (yeah, I know...). Clone or download the repo to the virtualenv project folder. Then do `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required Python packages. 

After that, you should be able to start the app with `python final_project.py` and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.
